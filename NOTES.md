Improving the Experience around Robot State Management

1.Enhanced User Interface: Focus on a clean, intuitive interface that allows users to easily visualize and interact with robot states. Implement customizable dashboards for personalized views.

2.Automated Notifications: Introduce real-time alerts and notifications based on state changes or predefined thresholds. Ensure these notifications are configurable to meet different operational needs.

Streaming Data/Logs from Robot to Application

1.Secure Data Handling: Implement encryption and authentication mechanisms to secure data transmission, adhering to industry standards and regulations.

Communicating Errors and Problems from Robot to Application

1.Error Code Standardization: Establish a comprehensive error code system with clear definitions and severity levels. Ensure error messages are descriptive and actionable.

2.Real-Time Alerts: Implement real-time alerts for critical errors or anomalies detected by the robots. Include contextual information and recommended actions for quick resolution.

Additional Properties for State Models

1.Environmental Sensors: Incorporate environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity) into state models to monitor and optimize robot performance in different conditions.

2.Diagnostic Metrics: Include performance metrics (e.g., CPU usage, battery level) for proactive maintenance and predictive analytics. These metrics can aid in identifying potential issues before they impact operations.
